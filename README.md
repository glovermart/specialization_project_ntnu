# specialization_project_ntnu (WIP)
Specialization project for the award of MSc. Electronic Systems Design.

The scope of work for this assignment is to perform experiments and suggest an optimal machine learning model
that predicts the execution time of aligning a short read to a reference human genome of the aligner in the 
SWARAM genomic sequencing algorithm (Variant Calling Workflow).
The goal is to use the predicted execution time to perform Dynamic Voltage and Frequencing Scaling(DVFS) management on an Odroid XU4.
Power and performance will be measured and compared with the task stealing scheduling currently being implemented on the device.

# Dataset = 4,000,000 reads with execution time
